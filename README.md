Nested Checkbox Component 

This project implements a Nested Checkbox Component using only HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.

The component supports hierarchical selection where parent checkboxes control their children, and child selections update their parents.

Category Level Selection → Selecting "Fruits" selects/deselects all fruits, selecting "Vegetables" selects/deselects all vegetables.

Individual Selection → Each item can be checked or unchecked independently.
